                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">During my 2 years in Senior High School, <br>
                        I became the lead layout artist for our School Newspaper. Throughout my whole experience, <br>
                        I learned that the functionality of a design is extremely relevant and proper <br>
                        layout guides the readers view and interest for each article.</p><br>

                        the specific years (2019 and 2022), the experience thought me how to handle <br>
                        big teams as well as communicate more efficiently to get points and <br>
                        suggestions across to all the members involved in the project. </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In my first year of college I was given the opportunity <br>
                        to design two of the T-shirt we were gonna be selling to raise money for <br>
                        charity in our NSTP Subject. This project allowed me make great bonds of <br>
                        teamwork as well as teach me how to adjust to customers preferences while <br>
                        also considering proper logistics management for all our products.  </p>

                        the customers desires, few of the items can be of everyday use or <br>
                        something very significant. Example of such commissions would be <br>
                        custom motorbike designs, wall design, or even shoes.</p>
